# What is deweb

Internet is broken, deweb fixes it. Currently deweb is a:

 - [ ] Anonymous P2P protocol
   - [ ] And library
 - [ ] Chat platform
   - [ ] One to one
   - [ ] One to many
   - [ ] Many to many
 - [ ] deweb browser
 - [ ] File cloud
 - [ ] Your bank

deweb is being built on a free and open source philosophy, with end user security, privacy, freedom and anonymity in mind.

And all of that is based <!--, and based --> on already existing technology. No reinventing of wheel, no need for a new protocol if one already exist, such as i2p, libp2p, tor, openpgp, monero, git and torrents.
